                <p>White space and clean design is crucial tool in web development. 
                    By effectively utilizing white space, web designers can make the site look clean. 
                    Web designers focus more on clearly conveying their message than creating a complicated user experience by creating a clean look. 
                    Above is a screenshot of the apple website with a mobile device. We can see that the negative space creates a hierarchy of information. 
                    First, your eyes are drawn to the newest model of the iPhone; then, your focus is on the small paragraph above the image. 
                    For this website, Apple is trying first to convince you to buy the latest model of the iPhone and secondly to place you in the right direction to make that purchase.</p>

                <p>A vital way web designers convey messages to their audience is through images. When selecting a picture for their site, designers should consider the rule of thirds. The rule of thirds is to divide a photo into nine equal parts by two-line running vertically and two lines running horizontally. Central elements of the image should be placed along the lines or on one of the intersections.<br>
                    <br>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints exemplifies this rule in their photography. Take the first image in the screenshot above. We see a picture of the Savior in the middle of a crowd of people, talking to a child. If we could divide the image into thirds, we would find that the Savior follows the right verticle line, and his body passes through two intersections. Because of the rule of thirds, we know that the central theme of this image is Jesus Christ and because this image is the first image you see when visiting the site, He is an essential element to the webpage. Below the first photo is a picture of a man. We can see that his face hits at least three if not all four intersections. Our eyes are drawn to him, and we know that he is a central element to the video. Through the use of images, the Chruch of Jesus Christ website conveys its mission to spread the gospel of Jesus Christ across the globe. It enhances this message through proper use of the rule of thirds.

                <p>A common way for designers to either establish or remove connections between objects is through proximity. One of the best examples of proximity is through the Daily Wire. In the Daily Wires web page screenshot, we can see articles grouped and close to the section's title. At the top of the screenshot, we can see that the articles at the top are the latest news. In the following sections, the articles are divided by their authors. While the reports are on different topics, they share some similarities, and those relationships are established through the section titles. By properly using the rule of proximity, web designers can create connections between objects and their message to the page in its entirety. </p>
